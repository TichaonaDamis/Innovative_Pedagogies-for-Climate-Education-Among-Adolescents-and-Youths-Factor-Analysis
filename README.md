Innovative Pedagogies for Climate Education Among Adolescents and Youths Factor Analysis

Project Background

Climate change has emerged as one of the most pressing global challenges of the 21st century, demanding not only policy-level action but also widespread public understanding and engagement. Adolescents and youths represent a critical demographic in this effort—they are both disproportionately affected by climate impacts and uniquely positioned to drive long-term environmental stewardship. However, traditional instructional approaches often fall short in fostering the depth of awareness, motivation, and behavioral change needed to empower young people as climate-literate citizens.

In response to this gap, education systems are increasingly exploring innovative pedagogies—experiential learning, digital simulations, project-based curricula, peer-driven initiatives, and community-embedded learning—to elevate climate education beyond conventional classroom instruction. While these approaches show promise, the evidence base on which pedagogical factors most effectively shape knowledge, attitudes, and climate-resilient behaviors among youth remains limited.

This project seeks to address that gap by applying factor analysis to identify the underlying dimensions that influence the effectiveness of climate education strategies among adolescents and young adults. Using structured survey data, the study aims to uncover latent constructs—such as environmental awareness, pedagogical engagement, digital learning readiness, civic participation, and emotional resilience—that drive meaningful learning outcomes.

By isolating these key factors, the analysis provides a data-driven foundation for designing targeted, high-impact pedagogical models that can be implemented by schools, youth programs, NGOs, and policymakers. Ultimately, the insights generated from this research contribute to shaping climate education approaches that are more engaging, evidence-informed, and aligned with the needs, perspectives, and learning styles of today’s youth.
